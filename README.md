## Blanktab for Google Chrome
Hey! Blanktab is an Google Chrome extension that provides a "About:blank" page instead of that boring "New Tab" page Chrome provides. A __must have__ for the minimalists! 

## But... That's it?

Yep, just at it sounds. And no, it doesn't have any invisible ads or something that may warm your computer. And it's actually __really__ small packed (293 bytes)

## Can I make it better?

Of course! That's why I created a repo for it. It's __OPEN-SOURCE__, meaning that you can download it, edit it, and make it better for me and for everyone that uses it!

## Contact for help
